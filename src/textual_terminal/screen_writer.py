"""
The Screen Writer: An API for manipulating the terminal grid state.

This module provides the `ScreenWriter` class, which acts as the primary
interface for the `Parser` to modify the terminal's screen and grid data.

Unlike tmux's `screen-write.c`, this class does NOT generate any ANSI escape
codes for display. Its sole responsibility is to update the Python data models
(`Screen`, `Grid`) in response to high-level commands. The Textual renderer
will later consume the state of the `Grid` to draw the UI.

All methods that in C would cause a write to the tty are instead translated
into modifications of the `self.screen` and `self.grid` objects.
