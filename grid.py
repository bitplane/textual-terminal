"""
The Grid: A data structure for representing terminal content.

This module provides the `Grid` class, which stores the state of a terminal
screen, including the visible lines and the scrollback history.

Unlike tmux's C implementation, which is a grid of fixed-size `grid_cell`
structs, this version is designed to be more Pythonic and leverage the power of
the Rich library. Each line in the grid is represented as a list of
`rich.segment.Segment` objects, which bundle characters and their style
together. This approach delegates rendering, line wrapping, and complex character
handling (like emoji) to Rich and Textual.

The primary responsibilities of this class are:
1.  Managing the scrollback buffer (a deque).
2.  Providing an API to read and write styled text at specific (x, y) coordinates.
3.  Handling scrolling and clearing operations by manipulating the list of lines.
