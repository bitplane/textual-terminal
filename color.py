Color handling for the terminal emulator.

This module is responsible for parsing color strings and managing the dynamic
256-color palette that legacy terminal applications can modify.

While the final display is handled by Textual, which has its own sophisticated
`Color` class, this module acts as a translation layer. It handles legacy
terminal color commands (like redefining palette entries or using X11 color
names) and converts them into the modern `textual.color.Color` objects that
the renderer expects.
