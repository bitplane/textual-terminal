# textual-tty

A terminal emulator for Textual apps.

Made by summarizing tmux's code, implementing a similar structure then almost
vibe coding it into existence with Claude and Gemini.

Currently lacks a cursor, mouse, any decent debugging tools, and is too chatty,
but it's still somewhat usable.

## Demo

```bash
uvx textual-tty
```

## Usage

There's 3 main classes:

1. `textual_tty.Terminal`, a standalone terminal that doesn't need Textual.
2. `textual_tty.TextualTerminal`, a tty widget subclass.
3. `textual_tty.TerminalApp`, a terminal emulator in a window.

See the demo for more info.
