"""
The Terminal Parser: A state machine for processing terminal input streams.

This module provides the `Parser` class, which consumes a stream of bytes
from a pseudo-terminal (pty) and translates it into high-level calls to a
`ScreenWriter` API.

It is a direct architectural port of tmux's `input.c`, implementing the same
finite state machine described by Paul Williams (https://vt100.net/emu/).

The core logic is in the `feed()` method, which processes each byte, moves
between states, and calls the appropriate handler methods for escape sequences.
