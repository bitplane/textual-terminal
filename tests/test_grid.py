"""
Test cases for the terminal Grid data structure.

These tests validate the core functionality of the Grid class, which is the
primary data model for the terminal's screen content. The most complex logic
involves the manipulation of Rich Segments when writing to or clearing the grid,
so the tests focus heavily on these splitting and merging operations.
